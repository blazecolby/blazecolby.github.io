#### I AM

### Blaze Rogers

---

I am currently the Business Analyst for Wolf Peak International, a distribution SME, as well as the Director of Data for The Quantum Daily, an early stage startup. I am currently working towards becoming a data scientist. I have a new found interest in explainability in ai. 

In my spare time I like to focus on machine learning and implement it where possible in both of my positions. 

This site is meant to act as a central place to collect machine learning projects, as well as a central place to keep track of code and ideas.
