# This page is hopefully a positive culmination of my ML/CS work.
{: .fs-9 }

Data scientist with strong leadership, project management, and programming experience. I have a special interest in information theory. When I’m not thinking about how much information a rock has in it, I like to jump into real-world problems with machine learning projects. In my free time, I like to read books on topics like the molecular biology of a cell or how to build a financial machine learning research team.

I’m experienced in SciKit-Learn, Postgres, Pandas/NumPy, TensorFlow, NLP, time series, regression/classification, and object-oriented programming. Building end-to-end systems is what helps my ambition to see ai benefit others.

I recently finished a data science fellowship where I had the opportunity to work with a ML/DL researcher from IBM medical sciences. Prior to this I was a business strategy consultant. As a data scientist I pull from this technical and leadership experience to excel in collaborative work in solving current problems.{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
