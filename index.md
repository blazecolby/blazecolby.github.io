#### I AM

### Blaze Rogers

---

I am currently the Business Analyst for Wolf Peak International, a distribution SME, as well as the Director of Data for The Quantum Daily, the go to place for quantum computing information. As the Director of Data I am tasked with establishing a data strategy and implementing it through the build of database systems, the establishment of partnerships, and the implementation of data pipelines.

In my spare time I like to focus on machine learning and try to implement it in my aforementioned roles as frequently as possible. 

This site is meant to act as a central place to collect machine learning projects, as well as a central place to keep track of code and recurring ideas.
