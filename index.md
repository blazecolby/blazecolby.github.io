#### I AM

### Blaze Rogers

---

Data scientist with strong leadership, project management, and programming experience. I have a special interest in information theory. When Iâ€™m not thinking about how much information a rock has in it, I like to jump into real-world problems with machine learning projects. In my free time, I like to play guitar, workout, and read.

This site is meant to act as a place to collect machine learning projects and writings.
