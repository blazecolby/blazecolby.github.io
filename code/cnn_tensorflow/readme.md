# CNN for Multi-Figure Identification

This project looks at how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to effectively identify a series of digits from patent images that are obtained from the United States Patent Office (USPTO) Database. 

## Problem Statement
I am attempting to predict numbers and letters provided by an image of patent drawings from the USPTO Database.

## Libraries
I used Tensorflow and Python to build this model. Tensorboard is also utilized.

## Report
A more detailed report has been written as well.

## Resources and Academic Journals
